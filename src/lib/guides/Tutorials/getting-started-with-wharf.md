# Build a blockchain TO-DO App using Wharf

In this video tutorial developers can follow along with a ~30 minute video to create a blockchain-based TO-DO App using Wharf on the [Jungle Testnet](https://jungletestnet.io/). The focus of this material is building a web client for a pre-existing smart contract already deployed on the network.
