# SessionKit Guides

Listed below are all the guides available for the Session Kit.

## Getting Started

#### [Web App](/guides/session-kit/getting-started-web-app)

This guide will generically walk through adding the Session Kit to any existing web application. The goal is to allow an end user of the application to authenticate with their own wallet and use it to perform transactions with their account.

#### [Node.js](/guides/session-kit/getting-started-node-js)

This guide will cover using the Session Kit to create a simple Node.js script. The goal of the script is to establish a Session with the Jungle 4 testnet and perform a simple token transfer to another account. Mastering these few concepts will open up the possibilities for a script to interact with any smart contract on any Antelope-based blockchain.
