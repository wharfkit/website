In which we talk about the Antelope library and Account Kit docs that will soon be released, and discuss how the team’s focus is now shifting to guides and tutorials as the bulk of the documentation is done. We also announce that we’ll be integrating account creation and private key generation into the Command Line tool, and discuss possible use cases for developers. Finally, we report on progress resolving the issue of account types that vary by blockchain, thanks to a combination of the Account Kit and the Common library.
